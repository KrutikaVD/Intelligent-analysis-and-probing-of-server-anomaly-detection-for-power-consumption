# Intelligent-analysis-and-probing-of-server-anomaly-detection-for-power-consumption
This idea we are proposing for WiT-AvrHackathon2021
The maintenance of the servers/infra is becoming challenging task. The servers are stationed at closer to place of business which often means no ideal power supply, network connection, trained staff. In such an environment infrastructure safeguard and maintenance becomes extremely unpredictable and difficult. Due to poor network/harsh physical environmental conditions the traditional methods of remote monitoring and maintenance will not work, since it completely depends on the connectivity to datacenter and multiple applications running within the server. 
There are several servers which can be found that are ideal since some stipulated time. When there is situation where application consumes more power and the user may or may not be have enough resources to measure the consumption and thus to analyze on overall power consumption. it is extremely difficult job to identify such servers and keep track of the same.
As the usage and dependency on infra increased, the following challenges exists in maintaining the server.
•	Identifying the servers where applications running consumes more power than expected.
•	Detecting the failures of the system in real time
•	Detecting the component malfunction which will lead to poor performance
•	Detecting the overuse/under use of resources which leads to physical damage of the components.
Idea is to analyze the data and come up with predictive model for maximum and minimum power required for each and every application by considering multiple parameters. Thus, to save the energy.
